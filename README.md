This repo contains all the code used to generate visuals in the video. I used 3B1B's library, manim. I ran the files by... cloning the manim repo and putting these files into the root directory of that folder. I know, yikes. It's a cursed setup that I don't even know if I can reproduce... I'll update this if I ever use manim again!

These files are quite disorganized; sorry about that! (I usually put much more effort into code structure and organization, but this time, I barely managed to dig up these files from my old laptop... I was happy to have just found the files at all.)
